# vue-shop
> A online shop demo using [Vue.js 2](http://vuejs.org/guide/), [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) & [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/). I've used the free Marvel Comics API to get lists of real products from different categories (in this way buying process looks a bit more realistic). Obviously, you can't really buy them :)
